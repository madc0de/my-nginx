# Nginx As Stream Server!

The first idea was to push the stream in different places in the same time from the same pc..

So to install this you need a vps/dedicated server or your pc if you have a good internet..

This can be done in All linux distros which support Nginx, But i'm using Ubuntu 14.04. And you should use Ubuntu 14.04 as server 
for this installation script. But if you have some knowledge you can take a look at my nginx configs copy them use whatever distro you want
build nginx rtmp module https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module and you can use it in different OS not just Ubuntu..

```
RAM    : 3GB+
CPU    : (As Nginx uses multi process you need a good one) 2.4Ghz+
SPACE  : 30-50+ GB (SSD)
UPLINK : 100MB/s + (Better 1GB/s)
```
